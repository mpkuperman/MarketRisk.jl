**MarketRisk.jl** is a Julia library wich provides high performance differentiable market risk measures for your portfolio. The library currently supports:

-  [Value at Risk (VaR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk): Most popular market risk measure which gives maximum possible loss given a confidence level and a time horizon.
- [Expected Tail Loss (ETL or CVaR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_shortfall): A more complete risk measure than VaR.
